# Reputils <img src="docs/reference/figures/logo.png" align="right" alt="" width="120" />

The Reputils R package is a _beta_ development version to facilitate analysis of transposable elements.

#### Features include:
 * Import of various TE coodinate formats
 * Curation of TE intervals
 * Mapping benchmarking
 
More details on the usage of Reputils is available in the package [vignette](https://tanaylab.bitbucket.io/Reputils/articles/Reputils.html). 

### Installation

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Install BiocManager (in case you haven't already)
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

# Install Reputils
install.packages('Reputils', repos = 'tanaylab.bitbucket.io/repo')
```

**Note**: Reputils requires R version 3.5 or higher. The package was tested on linux and macbook machines, but not on Windows. For improved speed performance, we recommend a multi-CPU/core workstation.
